## Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow

### Learning Objectives
- Understand  Tebuilding a TennsorFlow model using the Sequential API.

### Key Ideas
- **Understanding the keras api - layers, optimizers, losses, initializers, regularizers, metrics, callbacks**
- **Compiling the model,evaluating the model, and using the model to make predictions**
- **Understand the History callback to plot information about the model**
- **Custom callbacks**
- **Regularization - kernal/bias regularizers, batch normilization, early stoppping**
- **Saving and loading models and/or model weigths, loading pre-trained models, freezing training on certain layers**
- 

### Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Basic Image Classification
- Build, compile and train a neural network to classify images of numbers using MNIST dataset using CNN/Pooling/Flatten/Dense layers.

#### Assignment 2: Model Validation
- Use TensorFlow to classify iris flowers and evaluate the performance of the training and evaluation data sets.

#### Assignment 3: Saving and Loading Models
- Learn how to save model weights and load those weights into a model to produce the same results.

#### Assignment 4: Capstone project
- Use all of the things learned through the first 4 weeks to build, compile, fit and evaluate a nueral network to classify MNIST digits.
- Use callbacks - early stopping, learning rate adjustment, and model checkpoint for best weights.
- Use training and evaluation metrics to assess any overfitting issues with the data
